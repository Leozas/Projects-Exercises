# Mind Reader

### Description

Create a [single page web app](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58) that plays a game with the user to _read their mind_

For this project we will be using icon packages and primative state management

### MVP

By default, the app should prompt the user to click through the _single page app_ and see a new view for every step

You need to be able to scroll through the numbers to see your symbol (page 5 on the wireframe)

#### Wireframe

See [wireframe](https://xd.adobe.com/view/d4197d89-2c18-4e0e-5a01-c4ad9240fbc2-a228/)

#### Tech Stack

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS

### Process

##### Setup:

1. [Create GitHub repo (either online or locally)](../git-instructions.md), for example: `my-app`
2. Create necessary files for application and view in VS Code
   - Run shell script to expedite process unless you are using a framework
   - _If you are using a framework, disregard the "Application File Structure" section_
3. Import and route necessary css/js files (E.g. Bootstrap)
4. Save all and create your first commit to `master`, **then** switch to a dev branch

###### Application File Structure

Minimally:

```
web/
    index.html - main page
    css/ - folder to contain CSS files
        style.css - main stylesheet
    img/ - folder to contain any images
    js/ - folder to contain JavaScript files
        main.js - main JavaScript file
README.md - any important information
.gitignore - file that omits any directory/file from being tracked
```

Additional pages will be relative to the index.html file.

It is okay if your project has more files and directories, but you at least need the ones listed above.

##### Develop:

1. Create a `dev` branch to commit your code to
2. Add content and elements to your website
3. View changes and test locally
4. Save often, and commit to your development branch on GitHub when important changes happen
5. Push your commits to GitHub remote
6. For bug fixes, refactored code, and feature branches, you must create a branch off of `dev` onto a `new-feature` branch and create a PR into dev when complete

##### Deploy:

1. Create a Pull Request from `dev` into `master`
2. Confirm code is up to date and works correctly
3. Post links to your GitHub repo to the Projects Slack channel

### Requirements

To complete the assignment, you must complete the following:

1. Use JavaScript to successfully show the animation transitions
2. Successfully show state management for each step of the single page app( "view" 1, 2, 3, ..) without refreshing the page, this means that you will only create a single index.html
3. The restart button should not refresh the page, but rather, reset the state of the mind reader
4. Use Icons of your choice, we recommend [https://fontawesome.com/icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
5. All multiples of 9 should be the same symbol

#### Additional Requirements

- Pseudocode
- Website must be responsive
- Only one page is needed, manage state via updating a "state" variable that stores the current view to display
- Style your app as you wish
- Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website. To see what we have covered, check the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources).
- Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.
  - _**Remember to push to GitHub!**_
  - Potential employers will view your GitHub profile, so activity is crucial!

#### Stretch Goals

- Dynamically generate content using JavaScript
- Dynamically change CSS with JavaScript
- Use a Framework to generate the SPA

#### If you finish early...

1. Continue to add your own content, additions, and pages to your site and improve the styling.
2. Add info to your projects README.md [README.md Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)
3. Add links and resources from this week to the [Class Resources Repo](https://github.com/bootcamp-students/Resources) by forking the repo and then initiating a pull request with your additions to the .md file.
